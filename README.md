# Plex-Chromecast-Ultra / Chromecast Profile
This is a modified Chromecast.xml profile for Plex that is specific to the Chromecast Ultra. This allows you to set up custom 'optimise' targets.

Information updated from:

If any of the information in this profile seems wrong, please open a PR or issue to fix it. I had to make some guesses in places.
